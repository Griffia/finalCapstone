# Cypher

# --Description--
This Cypher was created as a project for the HyperDev Cyber Security Bootcamp.
It is a basic form of encryption based on a Caesar cypher. Changing each letter/digit 
to the 15th letter/digit after the letter/digit you have used. 
Lowercase/Uppercase letters and digits are only changed; punctuation and special characters are left alone. 

# --Installation--
*This project requires an IDE (Integrated development environment) that can run Python Scripts.*

You can copy the code from Github using the download raw file.
