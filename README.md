# Cypher

# --Description--
# This Cypher was created as a project for the HyperDev Cyber Security Bootcamp.
# It is a basic form of encryption based on a Caesar cypher. Changing each letter and number, 
# it will use the 15th letter and the 15th digit after the letter or number you want to use. 
# Lowercase, Uppercase and Digits are only changed, punctuation is left alone. 

# --Examples--
# c -> r    5 -> 0    K -> Z
# 05114986371 -> 50669431826
