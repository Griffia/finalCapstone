# Cypher

# --Description--
This Cypher was created as a project for the HyperDev Cyber Security Bootcamp.
It is a basic form of encryption based on a Caesar cypher. Changing each letter/digit 
to the 15th letter/digit after the letter/digit you have used. 
Lowercase/Uppercase letters and digits are only changed; punctuation and special characters are left alone. 

# --Installation--
**This project requires an IDE (Integrated development environment) that can run Python Scripts.**

You can copy the code from Github using the download raw file.

**If you copied the code from GitHub**

Open your IDE and create a new file and paste the code into your local file.
Remember to save your file, before running the code.

**If you downloaded the raw file from GitHub**

Open your IDE, find the location of the raw file and open the file.
Then run the code.

The program will prompt you to enter a sentence to encrypt.
