# Cypher

# --Description--
This Cypher was created as a project for the HyperDev Cyber Security Bootcamp.
It is a basic form of encryption based on a Caesar cypher. Changing each letter and number, 
it will use the 15th letter and the 15th digit after the letter or number you want to use. 
Lowercase, Uppercase and Digits are only changed, punctuation is left alone.
